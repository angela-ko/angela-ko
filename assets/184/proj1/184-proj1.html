    <h2 align="middle">Angela Ko</h2>

    <div class="padded">
        <p>I thought this project was due on the 18th, so I started much later than I should have which ended up with me not having enough time for me to complete the project. We used knowledge from the first 4 lectures to create texture mappings and anti-aliasing, and rasterization of images, and triangle meshes.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing Lines</h2>
        <p>For this part, I used Bresenham's algorithm. At first, the lines did not show up in the right areas until I added more constraints such as checking how steep the slope is and swapping x and y values if needed, e.g. if the y values are larger than the x values or if the slope is negative, etc.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h2>
        <p>For part 2, I first tried using the functions from the textbook, with the f12, f01, f20 and the barycentric coordinates. However, for some reason, even though I triple-quadruple-i-dont-know-the-next-number checked the formulas, it somehow just never worked out and would give me squares in the places of triangles for basic/test3.svg. Eventually, I gave up and switched to using the formula from Lecture 2, slide 118, which worked really well so I stuck with it. (Actually I went back to try and get the textbook formula to work but it didn't, so I reverted again) </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Antialiasing triangles</h2>
        <p>In order to implement supersampling, I created a new function called rasterize_pixel that wrote objects into a new struct called "superbuffer" that was bigger. The basic concept behind it was to draw an image and then downsize it by averaging out a cube with the dimensions sqrt(sample_rate) by sqrt(sample_rate). So in my rasterize triangle, the only thing I really changed was to make it call rasterize_pixel and write the pixels into a superbuffer instead of the framebuffer. I also made sure to resize my superbuffer in the resize function, initialize it as white in the redraw function, and also resize it in the keyboard calls.</p>
        <p>The main work done here was the resolve function, which I struggled on for a really long time. One of the main reasons why I struggled so much with this section is because I've never used C++ before and I've only had a limited experience with C from taking 61C, so alot of the syntactical things were really confusing to me, so I had alot of bugs dealing with floats vs ints vs other types. After I implemented resolve, I thuoght I was supposed to increment the other frame buffer values by 4 because I thought that each one of the buffer values was 4 bytes long, however, turns out I'm just using the x,y values so I was only supposed to incre
        ment by 1 each time. Because my whole color function was messed up and I was incrementing by 4, I ended up with this weird screen effect that made my images look really grainy</p>

        <p>All this made me really sad, then I went to the hw party, and suddenly I was getting seg faults!! But it turns out, I was intializing the size incorrectly because I was multiplying it by the squareroot of sample rate when the superbuffer's size is actually multiplied by not only the squareroot of the samplerate since I'm not just trying to index it by one of its dimensions. I also fixed some various syntax errors when I was manipulating my colors, and also I had to make sure that I multiplied the vertices of the original triangle by the square root of the sample rate since I am increasing the sample rate and basically trying to make a bigger image of the triangles that I can scale down later,<em>and</em> <b> HALLELUAH </b>, the best day of my life, my part 3 got to work</p>

        <p>However, although these triangles turned out nicely, the lines around my picture disappeared! So I had to modify rasterize_point to make it write into the superbuffer as well, making sure that I was writing into the superbuffer multiple times (as many times as the sample rate) since that's how much bigger the super buffer is than the frame buffer, and <em>VOILA!</em>, my lines came back!
        </p>
        <p>
        Later in part 6, I realized that apparently my code <em>isn't</em> completely correct. I wasn't rasterizing clockwise triangles. I realized that I was supposed to check and see, and when a triangle is clockwise, I have to make it counter clockwise. For some reason, I couldn't get it to work. I used a formula regarding dot products that I found on stack overflow, which is if dX0 * dY0 + dX1 * dY1 + dX2 * dY2 is positive, then the triangle is clockwise. Then I tried simply swapping the x0 and x2 values with hopes to change the direction of the triangle. Finally, it seemed to work.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Transforms</h2>
        <p>This part was a relief after part 3. It was fairly straightforward. I created my transformation matrices based on the Lecture Slides with the homogenous coordinates from Lecture (to-do) Slide (to-do). Afterwards, for move-view, I figured out what the original x,y, and span coordinates were based on set_view's function on how they were stored. At first, no matter what I did, it would just zoom in on the image alot, however, it turns out I forgot to add by span since I wrote a new svg_to_ndc matrix. So, I just used set_view with the modifications using my new dx, dy, and zoom values.</p>
        <p> I then created a new svg file using geometric primitives. I wasn't sure about the whole two matrices deep, and I wasn't sure if it was limited to one type of transformation per file so I did two turns of the same type of transformation in each file, so it's two matrices deep. </p>
        <p> They are in a file named part4 within svg</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 6: Pixel sampling for texture mapping</h2>
        <p>I filled in rasterize_triangle to pass in the sample params and the psm values, and I used the uv coordinates and my barycentric coordinates to calculate what the sp.uv value was. I also found the dx values for (u+1, v) and dy values for (u, v+1). Then after passing in my values, I was able to index into the mipmap and access the pixels and find the color values from there after scaling the u and v values by the dimensions of the mipmap. </p>
        <p> I used the bilinear algorithm from textbook page 246, however, it still looked wrong. I checked to make sure my UV coordinates were reasonable (which they were), and I made sure my alpha beta gamma values were sound, which they were, other than some which were like -0.000012 or something, but then i added a bounds to check, but I just somehow could NOT get it to work!!

        <p>Finally! After hours and hours of debugging, I found out that I was supposed to round the u,v values to ints whereas I was using floats the whole time! Incredible. Then the image showed up. However, for some reason, my code was incredibly slow (even in part 3), even after I applied the fix that Ben mentioned making sure that we don't step over the entire map each time, so I wasn't able to check if my bilinear looked ok.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 7: Level sampling with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
        <p>For this part, I calculated the dx and dy vectors using the methods mentioned above in part 6 (I guess I kinda did them together at the same time), and I scaled the uv du dv values by the width and height took the log of the max of the differences between the newly scaled texture uv du dv values.</p>
        <p> For some reason, I was unable to initialize a 3x3 matrix, which I later figured out it might've been because I didn't import it or something? So I used a systems of equations to scale the values into texture vectors.</p>
        <p>This was also very very incredibly slow, so slow that it took like 5 minutes to take a screenshot, and I checked my levels and made sure they were reasonable.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">A Few Notes On Webpages</h2>
        <p>Here are a few problems students have encountered in the past. You will probably encounter these problems at some point, so don't wait until right before the deadline to check that everything is working. Test your website on the instructional machines early!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Your main report page should be called index.html.</li>
        <li>Be sure to include and turn in all of the other files (such as images) that are linked in your report!</li>
        <li>Use only <em>relative</em> paths to files, such as <pre>"./images/image.jpg"</pre>
        Do <em>NOT</em> use absolulte paths, such as <pre>"/Users/student/Desktop/image.jpg"</pre></li>
        <li>Pay close attention to your filename extensions. Remember that on UNIX systems (such as the instructional machines), capitalization matters. <pre>.png != .jpeg != .jpg != .JPG</pre>
        <li>Be sure to adjust the permissions on your files so that they are world readable. For more information on this please see this tutorial: <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html</a></li>
        <li>And again, test your website on the instructional machines early!</li>
